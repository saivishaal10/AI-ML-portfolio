## Overview
This project presents an automated image capture system that detects human smiles in real time using classical computer vision techniques. When a smile is detected, the system automatically captures a self-portrait image.

## Key Contributions
- Real-time smile detection using Haar Cascade classifiers
- Automated image capture pipeline
- Lightweight and efficient OpenCV-based implementation
- Practical application of classical computer vision methods

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Haar Cascade Classifiers  

## Status
✅ Published  
🧠 Code implementation will be added shortly
